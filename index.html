        <p>Hello, I'm Anandmani Kumar!
            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a 2nd-year BSc Computer Science and Data Analysis student at IIT Patna. With a
            strong foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and programming, I’m passionate about solving complex
            problems using data-driven approaches.

            My projects range from implementing machine learning models to developing innovative applications in Python,
            showcasing my skills in libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. I’ve also explored cutting-edge
            technologies like NLP Cloud and object-oriented programming for building practical solutions.

            Beyond academics, I'm an active member of the Training and Placement Cell at IIT Patna, where I contribute
            to
            data cleaning and integration processes. My journey also includes experience in cricket, where I proudly
            represented my district at the U19 level.
